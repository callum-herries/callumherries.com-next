As a self-taught programmer, I spend a lot of time reading programming blogs to decide what to learn next.

This is a guide for separating the signal from the noise.

## Appeal to Anonymous Authority ##

Using evidence from an unnamed ‘expert’ or ‘study’ or generalized group (like ‘scientists’) to claim that something is true.

*“They say that the future of programming is functional.”*

## Appeal to Authority ##

Claiming something is true because an unqualified or untrustworthy ‘expert’ says it is.

*“Over 400 prominent companies are now using GraphQL for their APIs.”*

## Appeal to Common Practice ##

Claiming something is true because it’s commonly practised.

*“React.js is the best — everyone’s using it now.”*

## Appeal to Ignorance ##

A claim is true simply because it has not been proven false (or false because it has not been proven true)

*“Nobody has proven to me that using Vim is any more productive than using an IDE. So using Vim is a waste of time.*

## Appeal to Incredulity ##

Because a claim sounds unbelievable, it must not be true.

*“You’re suggesting that if we make our proprietary code open source for anyone to use, we could make more money? That’s rubbish.”*

## Appeal to Money ##

Supposing that, if someone is rich or something is expensive, then it affects the truth of the claim.

*“If this tool costs more than the open source version, it must be better.”*

## Appeal to Novelty ##

Supposing something is better because it is new or newer.

*“Awesome! the latest version of this operating system is going to make my computer faster and better…” [think Windows 7]*

## Appeal to Popular Belief ##

Claiming something is true because the majority of people believe it.

*“If you’re not adhering to agile practices, your team is going to be less productive.”*

## Appeal to Probability ##

Assuming because something could happen, it will inevitably happen.

*“You must write a description for every function. You might need to read it one day.”*

## Appeal to Tradition ##

Claiming something is true because it’s (apparently) always been that way.

*“We’ll never use anything but Javascript for client-side code.”*
